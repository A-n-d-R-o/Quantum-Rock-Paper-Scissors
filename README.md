# Quantum Rock Paper Scissors
Simple Qiskit program where you play rock paper scissors with a quantum computer. 
Program creates a W-state circuit and runs with StatevectorSampler. 
There is an additional cell for viewing the 'randomness' of the program.<br />
<br />
The additional file, 'W State.ipynb,' is from a different prject of mine, but is releveant here as it gives some background details on the W state. It also shows you how to execute the program on real quantum hardware, which the 'RPS.ipynb' file does not.<br />
<br />
Runs on Qiskit 1.1.0.
